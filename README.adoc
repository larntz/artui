= ArTUI

This is a TUI app for interacting with ArgoCD and managing apps. I have not worked on it with much frequency.

== Compatility

This is currently being developed against ArogCD version 2.4.x. 


== Dependencies

To setup dependencies use the replace() block from the https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/go.mod[argocd project `go.mod`] file. Then run `go mod tidy -compat=1.1.7`.
