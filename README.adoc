== TODO

=== Priority

* [ ] loading screen
* [ ] keybindings
* [ ] split modules so they can be updated separately and take focus
* [ ] use argocd code to generate k8s code for working with argo custom resources
* [ ] perform argo cd actions 
  * [ ] refresh
  * [ ] hard refresh
  * [ ] sync
  * [ ] remove finalizers, delete app, etc. 
  * [ ] manage ssh keys
  * [ ] manage gpg keys
  * [ ] manage repos
* [ ] view application metrics (based on resources in application object)

=== Someday 

* [ ] theme
* [ ] customize key bindings
